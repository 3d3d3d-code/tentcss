<h3>How do we determine what should be included in Tent CSS?</h3>

<p class="lead">We have worked tirelessly to strike a balance between being modular and caring deeply about default markup.</p>

<p>Our priority of inclusion is as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Our number one priority is to provide athestic enhancements for default markup elements.
        This means we place a strong emphasis on typography enhancements first and foremost.
        We stylize default elements and provide other class-based additions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Secondly, we aspire to create tools that can help quickly scaffold responsive layouts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Thirdly, and the most subjective of inclusion are the modular components we have created.
        Our goal is to only provide components that can be extended to form larger structures.
        Frivolous components have been excluded.
    </li>
